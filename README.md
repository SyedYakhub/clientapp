Project: MyDiary - A Personal Diary Web Application

Description: Developed a personal diary web application using Spring Boot. The application allows users to register, login, and perform CRUD operations on diary entries. The backend was built with RESTful APIs, which were consumed by the client application to interact with the database.

Key Contributions & Technologies Used:

- Designed and implemented RESTful APIs using Spring Boot for the backend of the application.
- Created Controllers for handling various HTTP requests related to users and diary entries.
- Developed Entities to map Java objects to database tables.
- Utilized Spring Data JPA to create Repository interfaces for accessing the database.
- Implemented Service classes to handle business logic.
- Built a client application that communicates with the REST APIs to perform operations on the database.
- Implemented user authentication and session management.
- Enabled users to perform CRUD operations on diary entries.
